# Exploratory and Predictive Data Analysis

For this analysis, I will use the openly available data from UK Gov website, Road Safety 2019:
<br>
https://data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data

## Project Motivation:
Road safety is a pressing concern for many countries, where road crash fatalities and disabilities are gradually being recognized as a major public health concern. It is our social responsibility to be aware of our surroundings and use science and knowledge to help solve real-world problems...
<br>

According to WHO (World Health Organisation nearly 1 million people die in road accidents each year.
<br>

## Business Understanding and Analysis Questions:
<br>

To better guide us through the analysis, I have formulated the problem into the following set of questions, So we can explore it at greater depth:
- Number of accidents and how it has changed over the year?
- When do accidents usually happen?
- What is the age distribution of drivers involved in the accidents?
- How is the severity of accidents depending on Speed limit?
- Different types of propulsion vehicles?
- What is the type of road which causes road accidents?
- Different types of accident severity?
- What are the predictors for road accidents?
- What are the circumstances for casualties?
And in this analysis I have explored problem from different prospectives, yet leaving so much to uncover.

## Plots:
In this section we will answer questions related to the nature and characteristics
of accidents:
