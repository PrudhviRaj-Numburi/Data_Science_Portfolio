## Case Study: [Image Recognition](Projects/Image-Recognition-Dog,Cat/Model/Artificial_Neural_Network_Case_Study.py)

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="Image/2a.jpg">

**Objective:** To identify the class which an image belongs a Dog image class or a Cat image class.<br><br>
**Task:** Using 8K images of dogs and cats to train Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) to predict whether the input image is a Dog image or a Cat image.

## [Loan Default Prediction](Projects/Loan-Default-Prediction-master/Loan_Default_Prediction.ipynb)

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="Image/2a.jpg">

In this project I applied various classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest and LightGBM to detect consumers who will default the loan. SMOTE is used to combat class imbalance and LightGBM is implemented that resulted into the highest accuracy 98.89% and 0.99 F1 Score.
