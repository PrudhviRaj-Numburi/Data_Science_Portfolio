## Case Study: [Image Recognition](Projects/Image-Recognition-Dog,Cat/Model/Artificial_Neural_Network_Case_Study.py)

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="Image/2a.jpg">

**Objective:** To identify the class which an image belongs a Dog image class or a Cat image class.<br><br>
**Task:** Using 8K images of dogs and cats to train Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) to predict whether the input image is a Dog image or a Cat image.

## [Loan Default Prediction](Projects/Loan-Default-Prediction-master/Loan_Default_Prediction.ipynb)

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="Image/2a.jpg">

In this project I applied various classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest and LightGBM to detect consumers who will default the loan. SMOTE is used to combat class imbalance and LightGBM is implemented that resulted into the highest accuracy 98.89% and 0.99 F1 Score.

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="Image/4a.jpg">
 
To access this app: [Click here](https://dataappsolution.herokuapp.com/)
<br>
  
This app will perform Automatic Data Analysis on any dataset. You have an option to upload your own dataset. Using this app we can perform a fast EDA analysis on any dataset. For trail purpose an example CSV is provided in the app.
<br>
<br>
 
## Note:
This solution do not substitute a more deeper analysis of your dataset. Because there is no treatment of the missing values, duplicated values and also problematic information on the columns. The main goal is to give a quicker overview of the contained information inside the dataset.
